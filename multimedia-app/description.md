## Description of the Two Features:

1. **Last Opened Time Tracking**: This feature keeps track of the last opened time for each file in the Multimedia Web App. It displays the elapsed time since the file was last opened in the recently opened files list. The time elapsed is updated dynamically as the user interacts with the app. The elapsed time is shown in a user-friendly format such as "Just now," "x minutes ago," "x hours ago," or "x days ago," depending on the duration.

2. **File Search Functionality**: This feature allows users to search for files based on their names or keywords. Users can input a search query, and the app will filter the files to display only those that match the search criteria. The search is performed in real-time, meaning the file list updates instantly as the user types their query. This enables users to quickly locate specific files within a large collection, improving the overall usability and efficiency of the app.

## Reasons for Choosing These Features:

These two features were chosen because they enhance the functionality and usability of the Multimedia Web App in different ways:

1. **Last Opened Time Tracking**: By displaying the elapsed time since the file was last opened, users can easily identify the files they have recently accessed. This feature provides a visual cue of the user's interaction history, helping them remember which files they were working on or viewing recently. It adds a sense of context and aids in navigation within the app.

2. **File Search Functionality**: Searching for files based on names or keywords is essential for users who have a large collection of multimedia files. It allows users to quickly locate specific files without manually scrolling through the entire file list. This feature saves time and effort, making the app more efficient and user-friendly.

## Explanation of How the Code Works:

The code for the last opened time tracking feature involves updating the `lastOpened` property of each file object whenever a file is accessed. This is done by modifying the `handleFileSelection` function to include a step that updates the `lastOpened` property with the current timestamp.

The code for the file search functionality involves adding an input field where users can enter their search query. The `handleSearch` function is responsible for filtering the files based on the search query. It uses the `filter` method to check if the file name or keywords match the search query. The filtered files are then rendered in real-time, updating the file list to show only the matching files.

Both features require manipulating and updating the state of the app to reflect the changes dynamically. The state is updated using React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks, which allow for managing the file list, selected file, search query, and last opened time in a reactive manner.

Overall, these features enhance the functionality and user experience of the Multimedia Web App by providing the ability to track recently opened files and perform quick file searches.
